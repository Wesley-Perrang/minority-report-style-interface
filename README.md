# minority-report-style-interface
I challenge myself to build a real-time minority report style interface into your own life. You need to connect calendar, gmail, whatsapp, photos and any inputs you can think of. Ideally you can search by contact and see communications across channels. Ideally you can toggle channels on / off.
